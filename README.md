# CREST: A Causal/Counterfactual RElations Schema for Text

CREST is created to help researchers working on causal/counterfactual relations extraction in natural language to communicate easier with each other. We invite researchers who create new and valuable data resources to contribute to CREST by writing a method to convert their data to this schema.
