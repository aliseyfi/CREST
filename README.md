# CREST v1.0: A Causal Relation Schema for Text

CREST is created to help researchers working on causal/counterfactual relations extraction in natural language to communicate easier and leverage all the created data resources around this topic. CREST v1.0 was created as part of an initial effort to convert/aggregate some of the most well-known data resources on causal relation extraction. In the following, you can find the information about all the converted data sets. 

### Available Data Resources
List of data resources already converted to CREST format:

### CREST v1.0 status
Based on all the useful feedback we received from the community, we apply some changes to CREST v1.0 and add additional data sets to it and present it as CREST v2.0. We archive CREST v1.0 and no longer make changes to the current data reader/converter class and notebook except for bug/error fixes.
