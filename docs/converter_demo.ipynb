    "## Reading Causal Relations Corpora\n",
    "By: Pedram Hosseini (pdr.hosseini@gmail.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been efforts in creating various causal relation corpora with different level of granularity and schemes. These efforts, even though admirable, are fairly sparse which makes it hard for people in the NLP community to use the generated knowledge. To take a step toward alleviating this problem, we wrote methods in a **Converter** class to convert all of these resources into a simple and friendly format so that anyone can easily use these samples. We try to keep most of the annotations from the original sources in the new schema so that no information will be lost during the data conversion. In the following, there is a list of current data sets which are covered in our collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SemEval 2007 task 4** - Public (source: **1**)\n",
    "- **SemEval 2010 task 8** - Public (source: **2**)\n",
    "- **EventCausality data set** - Public (source: **3**)\n",
    "- **Causal-TimeBank** - Not public (source: **4**)\n",
    "- **EventStoryLine (v0.9, v1.0, v1.5)** - Public (source: **5**)\n",
    "- **CaTeRS** - Public (source: **6**)\n",
    "- **BECAUSE v2.1** - Public (source: **7**)\n",
    "- **Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA)** - Public (source: **8**)\n",
    "- **Your data set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JOIN US\n",
    "We invite everyone in the ML/NLP/NLU community and groups of researchers who work on causal/counterfactual relations extraction in language to contribute to this repository, **crest/converter.py** in particular, so that we all take a step forward in improving the quality of availbale data resources and alleviate the sparsness issue."

      "French police responded to reports of car theft in a town near Paris late Tuesday and a shootout ensued with a group of alleged thieves . Most of them escaped but police captured one and he was later identified as a suspected ETA member , said the spokeswoman , who by custom is not identified .  Spanish media reported that the shootout occurred in the town of Dammarie-les-Lys .  The dead French policeman was wearing a bullet-proof vest but bullets struck fatally elsewhere on his body .  He was reported to be in his 50s , and the father of four children .  ETA has traditionally used France as its rearguard logistics and planning base to prepare attacks across the border in Spain , officials say .  But in recent years as Spain has enlisted increased cooperation from France in cracking down on ETA hideouts , there have been various exchanges of gunfire between ETA suspects and French police , wounding some officers .  Almost all of ETA 's fatal shootings and car bombings have occurred in Spain .  But in December 2007 , ETA shot dead two Spanish Civil Guards in France . \n"

      "The Athens protest march marking the zenith of the general strike called for the 5th of May was attended by an approximate 200 , 000 ( 20 , 000 which is the foreign broadcast number referring to the PAME march alone ) , although because of lack of media coverage due to the media participation in the general strike no concrete estimates can be made . After the PAME ( Communist Party union ) protesters left Syntagma square , the first lines of the main march started arriving before the Parliament with the first clashes erupting at the end of Stadiou street . The march then walked on the Unknown Soldier grounds leading the Presidential Guard to retreat , and attempted to storm the Parliament but was pushed back by riot police forces which today demonstrated a particularly staunch attitude and resolve against the demonstrators . Soon battles erupted around the Parliament with protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks , with one riot police armored van torched , and the police responding by extended use of tear gas that soon made Athens' atmosphere unbearably acrid . As more blocks reached Syntagma square , the battles spread across the city center and lasted for more than five hours . During the clashes several state buildings were set ablaze including the County Headquarters of Attika . At the time of writing the Ministry of Finance is reported to be on fire , and vital tax documents as destroyed by the raging fire . However the strange thing is that it is the fourth floor of the building that is burning , at a height inapproachable to petrol bombs . The building is in danger of total collapse . According to news reports that began at 14 : 00 Greek time after , under pressure by the events , most radio and TV stations decided to break their strike , claim that the fire at Marfin Bank's Stadiou street branch that has led to the death of three workers ( one a pregnant woman ) was started by protesters . However this remains an unsubstantiated claim . A similar case three decades ago had originally put the blame for the fire at Kappa - Marousi building on Panepistimiou street , leading to the death of several people inside , to anarchists , while its was later proved the fire was caused by tear gas fired by the police . After the tragic death of the three workers made the round of Athens , new clashes started to spread in the Greek capital , with a large crowd gathered outside the burned bank when Marfin's boss tried to visit the site . Clashes broke out between the crowd and police when the former attacked the bank magnate accusing him of forcing the dead workers to scab on a general strike and locking them in the building despite them demanding to evacuate it since 12 : 00 . In Parliament the Communist Party of Greece has accused the government for the deaths , claiming it was a result of agents provocateur fascist groups . The claims of the Communist Party are based on the fact that 50 fascists tried to enter the PAME demo bearing the flags of the union earlier in the morning . The fascists were spotted , chased and sought refuge behind riot police lines . Accusing the extreme - right as being behind the deaths , the Coalition of Radical Left has declared in Parliament that the government cannot pretend to be in grief for the loss of life , as it has been attacking human life by all means possible . Meanwhile , extended clashes broke out in Salonika where approximately 50 , 000 people marched destroying dozens of banks and corporate shops in Greece's second largest city . Clashes with the police continued for several hours . According to news broadcasts anarchist have occupied the Labour Center of the city . In Patras , around 20 , 000 protesters were joined by tractor drivers and garbage truck drivers on their vehicles , as flaming barricades were erected along central streets of the city and clashes developed between protestors and the police . In Ioannina the protesters attacked banks and corporate shops leading to extended use of chemicals by the police . In Heraklion , 10 , 000 people are reported as marching against the measures . In Corfu , protesters taking part in the anti - measures march occupied the County Headquarters . Protesters have occupied the Administrative Headquarters of Naxos and the City Hall of Naoussa . As a result of the Athens riots , the police have cordoned off the entire center of the city , erecting check points of entry and exit , while all police work permits have been recalled . At the time of writing battles continue to rage in the inner city , while news broadcasts claim the police is mobilising its forces to storm an anarchist squat in Exarcheia . \n"
