    "## Reading Causal Relations Corpora\n",
    "By: Pedram Hosseini (pdr.hosseini@gmail.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been efforts in creating various causal relation corpora with different level of granularity based on multiple annotation schemes. These efforts, even though admirable, are fairly sparse which makes it hard for people in the NLP community to use the generated knowledge by these resources. To take a step to alleviate this problem to some degree and to make it easier for people to benefit from these data sets with reach source of human annotation, we wrote methods in a **Converter** class to convert all of these resources into a simple and friendly format so that anyone can easily use these samples.\n",
    "We try to keep most of the annotations from the original sources in the new schema so that no information will be lost during the data conversion. In the following, there is a list of current data sets which are covered in our collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SemEval 2007 task 4** - Public (source: **1**)\n",
    "- **SemEval 2010 task 8** - Public (source: **2**)\n",
    "- **EventCausality data set** - Public (source: **3**)\n",
    "- **Causal-TimeBank** - Not public (source: **4**)\n",
    "- **Crowdsourcing-StoryLines 1.2** - Public (source: **5**)\n",
    "- **CaTeRS** - Public (source: **6**)\n",
    "- **BECAUSE v2.1** Public (source: **7**)\n",
    "- **Crowdsourcing-StoryLines 1.5** - Public (source: **8**)\n",
    "- **Your data set?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JOIN US\n",
    "We invite everyone in the ML/NLP/NLU community and groups of researchers who work on causal/counterfactual relations extraction in language to contribute to this repository, **crest/converter.py** in particular, so that we all take a step forward in improving the quality of availbale data resources and alleviate the sparsness issue."

      "French police responded to reports of car theft in a town near Paris late Tuesday and a shootout ensued with a group of alleged thieves . Most of them escaped but police captured one and he was later identified as a suspected ETA member , said the spokeswoman , who by custom is not identified .  Spanish media reported that the shootout occurred in the town of Dammarie-les-Lys .  The dead French policeman was wearing a bullet-proof vest but bullets struck fatally elsewhere on his body .  He was reported to be in his 50s , and the father of four children .  ETA has traditionally used France as its rearguard logistics and planning base to prepare attacks across the border in Spain , officials say .  But in recent years as Spain has enlisted increased cooperation from France in cracking down on ETA hideouts , there have been various exchanges of gunfire between ETA suspects and French police , wounding some officers .  Almost all of ETA 's fatal shootings and car bombings have occurred in Spain .  But in December 2007 , ETA shot dead two Spanish Civil Guards in France . \n"
